        <p class= "chiefs"> Patrick Mahomes was drafted by the Kansascity Chiefs in the
            <br>
            first round of the 2016 NFL draft.  He attended Texas Tech  <br>
            and even threw for over 700 yards in a game.  Mahomes is <br>
            playing out of his mind right now and many believe he will <br>
            be the GOAT.  GOAT is an acronym for greatest of all time. </p>
